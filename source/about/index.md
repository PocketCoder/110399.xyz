Born and rasied in Norwich, I studied Film Production at the University of Winchester.
Graduating with First Class Honours, I moved to London and fell into Youth Work where I still am.
In my spare time I write and develop websites and web apps.

Writing and creating story is something I'm still passionate about in my spare time and filmmaking is something I use in my work with young people.
